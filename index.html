    Lady Luck always seems to be throwing something good your way.\nWhen retrieving an Item from a Chest, there is a chance an Add-on will be attached to it.\n\n100\u00a0% chance for an Add-on of Very Rare Rarity or lower.\n10/25/50 % chance for a second Add-on of Uncommon Rarity or lower.\nAce in the Hole allows you to keep any Add-ons your Item has equipped upon escaping.\n\"Everything that glitters isn't gold. But gold isn't worth a damn in this place, so this should come in handy.\" \u2014 Ace Visconti
